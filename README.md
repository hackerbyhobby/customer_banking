#  Module 3 Challenge
> Module 3 Challenge for ASU AI Bootcamp

I did this assignment on my own, but there's a high possibility I help others as they experience challenges with their own code

In this challenge, I created a customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.

## Installing / Getting started

Run customer_banking.py which calls the main function
customer_banking.py requires cd_account.py, savings_account.py, and Account.py

```shell
customer_banking.py
```

Just follow the menu items and it'll print your interest earned and account balances!
